title: 'Automated Pull Request Suggestion Feature'
description: |
  Propose a feature to automatically analyze the repository for stale branches or unmerged changes and suggest relevant pull requests. This feature would help maintainers keep the codebase clean by:

  - Identifying branches that have recent work but no open PRs.
  - Notifying maintainers or suggesting the creation of PRs for these branches.
  - Optionally, providing a dashboard or notifications for suggested PRs.

  This automation can save time and reduce oversight, making the contribution process smoother and the repository more maintainable.
